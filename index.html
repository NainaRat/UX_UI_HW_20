                Project Overview :

                The Problem :
                              People who want to garden but don't have access to private gardens or balconies lack the physical space to cultivate plants and engage in hands-on gardening activities. This lack of access hinders their ability to reap the benefits of gardening, such as growing fresh produce, enhancing mental well-being, and connecting with nature.
                
                
                The Solution : 
                          Bud empowers aspiring gardeners with limited outdoor space by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that facilitates access to local gardening resources, fosters a supportive community, and promotes sustainable practices.

                User Research :
 
                Proto Persona 
                Initially, we created a proto persona based around the experience of tracking/caring for plants, whether that be inside the home or outside in a garden or yard.
                
                User Interview Plan :
                
                Background: Plants have become very popular in the day to day life of many people. Owning plants comes with a large set of needs to keep track of and learn about, such as different lighting, water intakes, and fertilizers. Track these needs can be a challenge for both new and veteran plant owners alike.
                
                Objectives: 
                We want to better understand users' pain points when caring for and tracking the needs of various plants.
                Understand what other apps/methods users are currently using to track plant care.
                Understand the motivations for users behind plant ownership, or why they don’t own plants.
                We want to better understand how users currently care for their plants (i.e. do they water, fertilize, prune?)
                
                 Methodology/participants: 
                5 one-on-one interviews with known plant owners via zoom, and then conduct an online survey shared through social media.
                
                Example questions:
                How do you typically care for your plants?
                How do you keep track of your plant’s needs?
                Have you tried any apps or websites to track plant care? How was that experience?
                
                Hypothesis: A plant health tracker app will make it easier for users to care for their plants, which will lead to increased satisfaction with their plant ownership experience.
                
                
                Survey Results :
                35 out of 38 participants were interested in gardening.
                Out of those participants, 69% said that they are unable to garden due to lack of space in their living environment
                To add, we found that another 23% said that they would be interested in being a part of a community garden.

                User Insight Statement :
                Aspiring gardeners need better access to local gardening spaces and supportive environments because many of their living situations are not conducive to gardening/do not include outdoor space, but they still want to grow their own produce and be more eco-conscientious.
                
                
                Problem Statement
                Many people who are interested in gardening lack the necessary space or resources to do so in their current living situations. This can be a source of frustration for those who want to enjoy the benefits of gardening, such as growing their own food, connecting with nature and others, and reducing their environmental impact.
                
                How might we…
                …create a fun, inclusive platform for gardeners?
                …facilitate better access to alternative gardening spaces and urban farming initiatives? 
                …connect new gardeners with more experienced gardeners?
                …help users achieve their environmental goals?

                User Task List :
                
                We created three different task flows before iterating on our user flow - one for onboarding, one for finding a garden near you, and one for sharing a photo within the community. These represent the task list we settled on after iterating a few options together.
                
                Onboarding task flow:
                Splash screen
                login page
                Sign up
                login

                Prototype Testing Plan :
                Our testing plan was to have 5 users test our design in-person, and record their actions as they complete the three tasks given below.
                
                To measure the success of our product, we watched for how easy it was to navigate each step of the tasks. 
                
                All users tested were able to complete the given tasks
                
                
                
                Task 1
                Create an account and complete the onboarding process
                
                Task 2
                Allow for Bud to access your location and set your distance to gardens within 5 miles. Then, bookmark your chosen garden.
                
                Task 3
                Join the group A community and take a photo and post!
                
                Testing Results :
                Testing feedback was positive overall. Users commented that the app was a great idea, useful, and excited them. Users also commented that even the lo-fi prototype seemed relatively detailed, and they appreciated the attention to that.
                
                In general, users found the interface straightforward, except when signing up for an account and also trying to locate a nearby garden. Too many different locator options created confusion for the user, and we got feedback that we should streamline that and also make sure the radius slidable. Since finding the closest garden to you was the inspiration for the app, that took top priority right after being able to actually create a Bud account easily.
